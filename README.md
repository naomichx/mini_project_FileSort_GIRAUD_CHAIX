We wanted to make a program which sorts photoshoot files (from an unsorted folder with a lot of photos) according to the day of shoot and type of file and 
puts automatically the files in sorted and named folders (first by year then by date of shoot) with the help of the exif data.

The RAW files are treated separatly, to be more easily transfered to software such as lightroom

We use Pillow as an image processing tool in python 
you can install it with the following code lines : 

python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow

Versions needed : 
Python -- Python 3.8.6
Image (PIL) -- '7.0.0'
